Additional Ways to Monitor my AWS account for security:

1. You can monitor S3 Bucket Public access by looking for any bucket that has public access permissions.
Fucntions: get_bucket_acl, get_bucket_policy


2. You can monitor EC2 Security Groups for open ports. This would check the security group rules for any ports that are wide open to the network.
Things like 0.0.0.0/0 for SSH
Functions: describe_security_groups


3. You can set up monitoring for IAM policies for wildcard permissions. This would look for policies that grant any wildcard(*) permissions or access to
wildcard resources.
Functions: list_policies, get_policy_version
